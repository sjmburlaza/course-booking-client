# School of Arts and Tech
This project is a school web application integrated with CRUD operations mainly for booking classes.
I separated this client side repo also known as frontend from the server(backend) for separation of concerns purposes and easy deployment.
This client side repo was deployed through Vercel hosting service.

The demo of the project can be found [here](https://course-booking-v2.vercel.app/)
